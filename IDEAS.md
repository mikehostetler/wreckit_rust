I want to port the Reckett tool that's currently in TypeScript. I'll give you the folder to reference it on the local file system. I want to evaluate all of the features embedded in that tool. It is effectively a loop that utilizes the Cloud Code SDK to iterate over a deterministic workflow to make changes to a software project, all wrapped into a CLI tool. I want you again to evaluate this, wrap the Cloud Code SDK, go through each loop step, orchestrate the prompts, and then push a pull request with the end results. The code is in TypeScript right now. You can see a working implementation and evaluate it. I want full unit tests for all the pieces of this. I want a data-driven core that really focuses on immutable and idempotent data operations and then a TUI user interface because the primary way to interact with this will be on the command line. And I need you to fully wrap the Cloud Code SDK. So as we go through our prompt sessions and the workflow, I can be requested or asked clarifying questions by the agent to get better results. And all of the information is stored to a .recket folder in the appropriate place. Again, you can reference this implementation in the TypeScript version. Map this out for me.
